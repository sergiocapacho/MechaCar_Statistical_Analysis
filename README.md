### 1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Spoiler_angle and AWD provided a non-random amount of variance tothe mpg values in the dataset
### 2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p=value of the linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11 which is less than the assumed significance level of 0.05%, that take is to reject the null hypothesis.
### 3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
No, this linear model is not ideal as the majority of variables do not contribute to a random amount of variance to the linear model.
