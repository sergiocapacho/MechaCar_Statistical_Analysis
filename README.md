### 1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Spoiler_angle and AWD provided a non-random amount of variance tothe mpg values in the dataset
### 2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p=value of the linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11 which is less than the assumed significance level of 0.05%, that take is to reject the null hypothesis.
### 3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
No, this linear model is not ideal as the majority of variables do not contribute to a random amount of variance to the linear model.

### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

The current manufacturing data does not always meet the design specification for all manufacturing lots, in total is very close as it can be seen in the summarized table, but lot by lot it shows a very high variance in lot 3, which can be a big problem. 

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

### Metrics to test: Maintenance frequency per year and mpg
